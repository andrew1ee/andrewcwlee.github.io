OpenAI has released ChatGPT to the public on November 30, 2023. Since then, ChatGPT and similar LLMs (Large Language Models) have revolutionized the daily workflow of many people. I wanted to test the power of LLMs by doing an interesting experiment.

Recognizing the growing trend of using GPT for generating blog posts, I wanted to take it a step further and automate the entire process. Thus, I created ["The Mosaic Living"](https://themosaicliving.com), a fully automated blog that enables me to effortlessly publish an article every day.

My approach involves leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate articles in the desired categories, generating them in Markdown format. I then utilize the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) framework to generate a static website. By automating the build process on a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) server, I ensure that my site remains up-to-date and accessible to visitors.

Initially, I had concerns about the suitability of AI-generated content for platforms like Google, given their efforts to filter out low-quality posts. However, to my pleasant surprise, my application for Adsense ads was approved on April 12, 2023, after publishing approximately 100 posts. This offers some of hope, despite the current financial deficit, though very minimal, posed by the costs associated with OpenAI's API usage and the domain.

While profitability may not be immediately evident, and I expect not much from it, I am maintaining this project and observing its progress over the coming years out of pure curiosity. Who knows what will happen in the future?
