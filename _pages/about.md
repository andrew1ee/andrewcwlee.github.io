I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at UC Davis. I am also a member of [Laboratory for AI Robotics, and Automation (LARA)](https://soltanilab.engineering.ucdavis.edu), where I am fortunately advised by [Dr. Iman Soltani](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/soltani/). Prior to UC Davis, I earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Hanyang University.

My research interests mainly focus on the intersection of Deep Learning and Robotics, with special emphasis on domain adaptation, representation learning, and generative models. I am deeply intrigued by the complexities and potential that these areas offer in the development of flexible, robust systems capable of functioning effectively in diverse environments and circumstances.
